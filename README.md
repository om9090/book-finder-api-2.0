# BookFinder

BookFinder is a simple web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. This project was originally [a school assignment](https://livoszlak.github.io/book-finder-api/) I worked on during my first year of web development studies, when I was just starting to learn about APIs, but I thought it would be fun to refactor what I had into utilizing a framework and some nicer styling. This 2.0 version is built with React and Vite.

## Dependencies

- React DOM: ^18.3.1

3. Get your own Google Books API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:
